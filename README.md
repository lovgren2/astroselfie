# Astroselfie 
#### Creates a GIF of the nightsky from the perspective of an observer on another planet in the solar system (e.g. the nightsky from an observer on Mars)
- python3 astroselfie.py creates an animated GIF of the nightsky in the folder in which the script was run
- python3 astroselfie-parallel.py spawns multiple python instances to create the image files for the animated GIF
- astroselfie_orbits.ipynb and astroselfie_precompute.ipynb can be run from a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook. The output is an animated GIF saved in Colab's Files folder. The output file is also downloaded to the local file system.
